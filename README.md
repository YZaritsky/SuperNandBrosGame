# Nand2Tetris - Super Nand Bros. Game Project

## Overview

This project is part of the Nand2Tetris course, which involves building a modern computer system from the ground up. In this project, we focus on developing higher-level software components using the Jack programming language(that was made for the project's purposes) and the VM language.

## Project Structure

- **Main.jack**: The entry point of the project, which initializes and runs the game loop.
- **Map.jack**: Manages the game map, including rendering blocks and coins, and handling player interactions.
- **Items.jack**: Contains functions to render various game items such as blocks, poles, and coins.
- **Coin.jack**: Defines the behavior of coins, including their animation and collision detection.
- **Block.jack**: Represents individual blocks in the game, including their type and location.
- **Game.jack**: Manages the overall game logic, including player movement, collision detection, and game state transitions.
- **MapLayout.jack**: Provides the layout of the game map, including the positions of blocks and coins.

## How to Run

1. Compile the Jack files using the Jack compiler provided in the Nand2Tetris tools.
2. Load the compiled VM files into the VM emulator.
3. Run the VM emulator to see the game in action.
